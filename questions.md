The aim of the app is to build a meal, so after the search, once the user taps on an item, it should be added to the meal and give a grand total of calories eaten. Note: one tap is eaqual to one portion each time.

Create a new view which would display the above information in @FoodDetailView. Make sure that there is a viewmodel responsible for the business logic.
